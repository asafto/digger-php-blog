# digger-php-blog
My first php web implementation. The project is based on Vanilla PHP, with HTML, Bootstrap, with minor CSS and JS (JQUERY).

## Installing locally digger-php-blog
Please note that after cloning digger-php-blog, you need to have a local installation of APACHE with PHP and MYSQL database.
For window users, you can install the xmapp application. Please make sure you install xmapp directly under your C folder. For MAC users, any equivelant to xampp will do. 

1. Once xampp is installed, please locate the project folder inside the htdocs folder (under C:\xampp\htdocs ).
2. Please verify you have APACHE and MYSQL turned on. Push the start button for both, from the xmapp control pannel. Make sure what is the port used by APACH (by defualt, APACHE is using port 80 --> To change the default port, please follow the xampp documentation).
3. In this project, you have a mysql db dump file that you should import into your localhost mysql instance. This dump file is for an clean, structure only db dump.
4. To work on your mysql database, you can open phpmyadmin consol from the xampp control pannel. phpmyadmin can be open by clicking the admin button, located on the mysql line in the control pannel.
5. Once you have all of the above established, open your browser with localhost and click on the name of the project folder.
6. Click on the signup link, create your first user, and create your first post.
7. The blog can be viewed by any user, registred or unregistered.
8. Posts can be added only by regitered users.
9. Registered users, can update or delete their own posts.
